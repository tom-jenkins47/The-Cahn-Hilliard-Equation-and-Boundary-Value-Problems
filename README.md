# The-Cahn-Hilliard-Equation-and-Boundary-Value-Problems-
Code to simulate the spinodal decomposition of a phase-separated fluid mixture and various electric and magnetic field effects. The code uses a finite differences scheme to numerically solve the non-linear Cahn Hilliard equation, and boundary value methods to simulate the behaviour of different electrostatic and magnetic fields.
